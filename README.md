# Spherience
Proyect of interactive guide of the old airport in the University of Alicante.

You are inside the Github of the Spherience app. Spherience is an experimental VR app developed for the subject of Multimedia Systems on behalf of the University of Alicante. 

Our main objective, as a didactic experience, is teaching about the history of the University of Alicante and specificatly about the old airport "La Rabasa", placed in the nowadays territory of the university. Anyone interested can download our app from Play Store and try it for free. You will need a Google Cardboard to enjoy the full experience. 

Due to the VR nature of our project, this git is full of beta apps and VR libraries and assets. 

We have used diverse versions of Google VR assets for Unity to make this app. Also you have access to a library of 360 non-stereoscopical photos used inside the app and with testing purposes. 
There is also some scripts in our proyect from really generous content creators, our system of sphere change and 360ยบ images proyection systems are based on their work, endless and infinite gratitute!:
